# Hi there 👋 I’m Marcelo Feliciano Filho  
**Technical Team Lead | Software Engineer | PhD Student**

## 🎯 About Me  
I’m a passionate software engineer currently working as a Technical Team Lead. With a strong background in Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker, I love building robust web applications and leading teams to deliver high-quality software. 

At the same time, I’m pursuing a PhD at [PUCPR] (or the actual institution) in the field of software engineering / artificial intelligence (or your specific research focus), where my research focuses on developing AI/algorithmic solutions for real-life problems.

My core strengths:  
- Web-development (backend & APIs)  
- Data modelling & databases (PostgreSQL)  
- Containerization & DevOps workflows (Docker)  
- AI/algorithms: applying research to production-ready systems  
- Team leadership & mentoring

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
Here are some of the technologies, frameworks, and tools I regularly work with:

- **Languages**: Python, (add any others: e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Java)  
- **Web & Backend frameworks**: Django, (maybe Flask / FastAPI)  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, (maybe MySQL, MongoDB)  
- **DevOps / Infrastructure**: Docker, (maybe Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD)  
- **AI/ML/Algorithms**: (mention specific libraries or frameworks if applicable: e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- **Other tools**: Git, (maybe Jira, Confluence, etc)

## 📁 My Work & Projects  
Here on GitHub you’ll find a mix of:  
- Production-ready applications I’ve worked on or led  
- Research-oriented code tied to my PhD / AI interests  
- Utility scripts and tooling for dev productivity  
- Side projects, experiments and open-source contributions  

**Some highlights**:  
- [Project A – short description of what it does]  
- [Project B – short description of what it does]  
- [Project C – short description of what it does]

## 🎓 Education & Continuous Learning  
- Currently pursuing a **PhD** in (Software Engineering / Artificial Intelligence) at PUCPR (or full name).  
- Always learning: I recently completed courses such as the “Leveraging Cloud-Based Machine Learning on AWS: Real-World Applications” (via AWS SageMaker). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🚀 Fun Facts  
- I believe deeply in building software that solves *real-life problems*, not just fun demos.  
- I enjoy the duality of research (in my PhD) and production software engineering — bridging theory and practice is what excites me.  
- Outside of code, I like (you can mention hobbies/interests: e.g., hiking, reading, board games, etc)
